### Opposites attract!

Similarly, coders and marketers attract.
Or, Investors and Founders attract.
and so on...

We often network with the one we need.
There are webinars, networking groups where we find people / founders like us.
That is one channel where one is working himself.

The good news is, we can add more channels.

Contribute to others growth.
Be nice, it doesnt cost anything.
You just need to invest some time and provide value to others.

If you know a good baker and someone is looking for a cake, refer them.
If someone asks feedback for their business, be honest.
If you dont like something, say them what is missing that could have been better.
