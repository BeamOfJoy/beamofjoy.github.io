An article in Forbes magazine recently identified the “subscription economy” as one of the fastest growing economic sectors. A subscription economy is defined as a business model in which customers pay a recurring fee in exchange for access to a service or product. The subscription economy has been growing steadily for the past few years, and shows no signs of slowing down.

There are a number of reasons why the subscription economy is thriving. First, customers are increasingly interested in convenience and simplicity. A recurring subscription eliminates the need to constantly search for new products or services, and makes it easy to budget for recurring expenses. Second, subscription services often offer a more personalized experience than one-time purchases. 

**What is the subscription economy?**
The subscription economy is a business model where customers pay a recurring fee to access a service or product. This type of business model has become increasingly popular in recent years, with companies such as Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon Prime all offering subscription-based services.

There are several reasons why people love the subscription economy. Firstly, it offers convenience and certainty – customers know exactly how much they will be paying each month, and they don’t have to go through the hassle of buying individual products or services. Secondly, it can be cheaper in the long run – for example, if you subscribe to a streaming service like Netflix, you will likely end up paying less than if you bought DVDs or went to the cinema every week.

**Why do people love the subscription economy?**
The subscription economy is a model of business in which customers pay a monthly or yearly fee to receive access to a service. The service can be anything from a product, like a box of monthly wine, to a service, like unlimited access to a library of e-books. The subscription economy has been growing in popularity in recent years, as customers have become more accustomed to paying for access to services rather than owning products outright.   
There are several reasons for this trend:
- convenience: customers can have the products or services they need delivered to their door without having to go out and buy them themselves.
- flexiblity: customers can cancel their subscriptions at any time, without being locked into long-term contracts

An Easy example of subscription is Gym membership. You do not purchase the needed equipments at home, and do not have the space needed to store it. So you take a gym membership that allows access to the gym equipments.
Another example is Netflix.
