We all know many ideas are born during shower. So we call it showerthoughts.

Apart from that, there are few more events.
- Sleep. We wake up with a new solution in mind.
- Movie break. When we move our mind completely out of work and relax watching a new moview or a webseries. Once we start back again fresh, we can have a new direction and idea.
