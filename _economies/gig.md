Back then a few years ago, people would see government jobs as the best where you had to work in fixed time frame then came in private sector which allowed you paid leaves, vacations etc and were attractive but still here it was fixed time frame of say 9 to 5!

With time passing people realized that if you have right amount of talent and are confident enough to fetch any deal across the employer will come to you and you need not go to him. Here sprung up the new normal of people working as per their convenience in multiple shifts and ample breaks.

Giving rise to Gig economy – the benefit is you are not committed for years to go. You have a target, a set contract with rules and you choose when to accept and when to not. You have the freedom to set your plans as per your availability.

The word gig has its origin from the 1920s jazz concert where musicians referred to their concert as “gig”. And with its literal meaning you work like the musicians of the concerts. Freelancing and FTH (Fixed Term Hire) are upcoming ways to employ people and get employed as well.

The entire cycle works on demand and supply principles. You need to attract the right audience for getting employed rightly for which being technically sound is key to success. 

So basically, this model works in a way where your client posts their requirement like logo designing, caption writing, SEO, drawing, illustrating a comic or a cartoon. Services like Voiceovers, video editing, Animations etc and you take up the assignments as per your availability. There are no pressures as you choose how much and what you can do.

The active models in this area is the LinkedIn platform where there are daily posts for active hiring, car owners which tie up with companies like Ola and Uber on daily basis whether their car is available for pickups, the delivery partners of apps like Swiggy, Zomato, Dunzo work as per their availability – where its upto you to accept the delivery or not!?
