Do you remember using the same cycle from eldest sibling of the family to the youngest one? Or do you recall any of the memories of where we would get old books of someone in the next class and read it in summer vacations!? Have you read posters at the library saying donate old books? Do you remember wearing your elder brother’s shirt and being so happy to look like him?

I am sure you must have recalled many such incidents where we actually lived the term “Mummy ne sikhaya!! Sharing!!!”
Now let us take this concept to a broader level – here comes the same concept dressed up in technical language adding element of some business terms – Sharing Economy
So, the sharing economy “is an economic model often defined as a peer-to-peer (P2P) based activity of acquiring, providing or sharing access to goods and services that are facilitated by a community based on-line platform” as per Investopedia.

Can you imagine the sales revenue from the companies following this model is expected to rise to a whopping 335 billion US Dollars by 2025 as per reports of PWC, so won't it be the need of time to get yourself adapted to the new normal and find the best opportunities for yourself!?

The Sharing Economy can be described as an economic model where physical assets are shared by individuals and groups in a manner that these assets serve as services. The major reason for this model being highly successful is because of its reach through online platforms.
Platforms like OLX where we buy and sell our things, eBay where consumers can easily buy or sell products with shipment till your doorstep, Airbnb where you share houses/villas, zoom cars where you can drive in the car you want for time you want just by paying the fees quoted and the list goes on. Not to anyone’s surprise – People also rent their wedding clothes and jewellery because of the fact that these heavy dresses are just a one-time wear and then will be occupying a part of the wardrobe which won’t be looked at for years.

These models have proved its success ratio overtime. With more and more people believing in the minimalist theory of living they have started focusing more on the utility of an asset than its ownership. I can recollect the Goa Vacation we had a few years back where for the first time we used the Oyo app for booking our stay. Shifting from the typical hotel room bookings to that of a villa for our weeks’ stay was really a wonderful decision.
The areas emerged for individuals due to this is freelancing! **Open LinkedIn** and you find **every 5th post** saying **I quit my handsome paying job to start what I love doing!** Many sites have started hiring people as and when needed. You as a business don’t have to involve someone on payroll and the person giving services is also not trapped in a **9-5 frame**!

Given the Nature of work from home, sometime people prefer to use a office when there is a meeting and they need a silent place. But as they stay in remote city, they company might not have office. People are used to the posh office with AC and the amazing coffee. Taking this in mind, few people have started a new concept of co-working space. They install all the necessary facilities, hire the house keeping staff and take away all the overheads of cleaning, maintenance. All the customer needs to do is pay the fee for a shared desk. Today the desk belongs to him, tomorrow to someone else.

This model indeed has a win-win situation for both sides – for the person owning the asset or the service provider – he gets a value in return of the amount invested or the freedom to work as per his convenience and for the person using the asset/service – he does not have to invest heavily at one go instead can enjoy the service at a comparatively lower rate. One does not have to pay commissions to middle men as most of these models have direct communication with the consumers.
So, all in all – Sharing economy is **“What is mine is yours, for a fee!”** Basis for this model is assets sitting idle and advances in technology to allow seamless flow of information throughout the globe! Of course, this isn’t new to us because we have been taught to share things since childhood but with time, we have learnt sharing wisely.

This idea of sharing economy has changed the meaning of ownership – now access is the new ownership, because it is less expensive to have access to the goods than to own it. People have started believing in the idea that I don’t need a car, I just want to drive! People are more fascinated with the thought of having their work done than flaunting off the tools through which it was done.
