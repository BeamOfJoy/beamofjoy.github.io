A Marketplace is a platform where sellers and buyers meet.
It can be a physical product or a digital product.
It is not always a product but it can be service too.
It can be an e-commerce listing clothes or a hotel listing available rooms on rent or a bus owner listing available seats in the route.

Sometimes it can be 3-way product. Lets explain with an example.
- A customer who orders food.
- A Restaurant that cooks food.
- A Delivery Partner that will take care of reaching restaurant and delivering it to the customer.
