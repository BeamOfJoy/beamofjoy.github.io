## Use Cases of Blockchain-based Traceability

### 1. Agriculture & Food Safety
Track the journey of food from farm to table, ensuring product authenticity and safety. With blockchain, every step in the supply chain is recorded immutably, allowing consumers to verify product origins, quality, and compliance with regulations.

### 2. Pharmaceutical Industry
Ensure the authenticity of pharmaceuticals by tracking the entire lifecycle of drugs, from manufacturing to distribution. This helps prevent counterfeit medicines from entering the market and improves compliance with regulatory requirements.

### 3. Luxury Goods & Fashion
Verify the authenticity of high-end fashion items, jewelry, and luxury goods. By tokenizing each product, businesses can provide a digital record of ownership, ensuring that each item is traceable back to its origin.

### 4. Automotive & Aerospace Parts
Track and trace every part used in complex automotive or aerospace supply chains. By logging every transaction and movement of parts, manufacturers can ensure safety standards and avoid the use of counterfeit parts.

### 5. Electronics & Hardware Supply Chains
Ensure the authenticity and quality of components in the electronics industry by tracking the lifecycle of each product part, reducing risks of faulty or counterfeit products entering the market.
