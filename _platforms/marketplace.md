### Marketplace Platform.

A marketplace platform is a type of online platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact with each other.   
The platform typically provides a variety of features and functions to facilitate the transaction process, including
- listing items for sale,
- processing payments,
- managing shipping and delivery.
Marketplace platforms have become increasingly popular in recent years, as they offer a convenient and efficient way for businesses to reach a wide audience of potential customers.

For buyers, marketplace platforms offer a convenient way to compare and shop for products from a variety of sellers. 

For sellers, marketplace platforms provide an easy way to list and sell products, and to reach a large number of potential customers. There are a number of different marketplace platforms available, each of which offers its own unique set.

Marketplace platforms typically provide a marketplace website and/or mobile app that allows businesses to list their products or services, and customers to browse and purchase items
. Some marketplace platforms also offer additional features, such as payment processing, shipping, and customer support. Others may simply provide the marketplace website and/or mobile app, and leave the rest up to the businesses and customers themselves. 

- It can be a physical product or a digital product.  
- It is not always a *product* but it can be *service* too.  
- It can be an e-commerce listing clothes or a hotel listing available *rooms* on rent or a bus owner listing available *seats* in the route.

Sometimes it can be 3-way product. Lets explain with an example.
- A customer who orders food.
- A Restaurant that cooks food.
- A Delivery Partner that will take care of reaching restaurant and delivering it to the customer.
