If your customers trust you, they act like marketers of your business.
Word of mouth makes a big impact. Both positive or negative.

Its not always the cost that matters.
How deeply knowledgable are you can win the trust.

How to win if your competitor is selling for less than you?
Make customer feel they are saving time by spending more on your product/business.
`Trust` is one of the words for it.
