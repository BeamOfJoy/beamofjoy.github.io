**Introduction**

Things I need just once. I would better take it on rent.

Matching color jewellery, purse, and shoees with my dress. Better rent it then buy.
Tomorrow there can be a better trend.

From one person to another, the owner will keep it maintained. So, its in a good condition for new person.

Similarly, Books I studied this year are no more needed next year. They are costlier to buy.
Better rent them this year and then return them next year.
