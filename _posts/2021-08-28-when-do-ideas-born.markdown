We all know many ideas are born during shower. So we call it showerthoughts.

Apart from that, there are few more events.
- Sleep. We wake up with a new solution in mind.
- Movie break. When we move our mind completely out of work and relax watching a new moview or a webseries. Once we start back again fresh, we can have a new direction and idea.
- Discussion. If you are facing difficulty in using something or need opinion, discuss it. Tweet it or ask your friends, better post questions in group. The answers can lead you to something new.
Facebook groups, Quora, Reddit are good online platforms to get answers from strangers with similar taste.
