If you have a good product, but still customers still dont know you?

You can consider these strategies.

1. Use Coupons.
Share discount Coupon for Events, discount on first order. If they like your product, they will order it again in future.

2. Affiliate Marketing.
As name suggests, ask influencers in the niche to share your product link with their affiliate code.
So the audience considers the product and end up buying.

3. Put your Business Name and Website wherever you can.
When you meet new people, share your Business card. You never know who might need the product.

4. Conduct Knowledge Sessions.
Create Webinars. Ask people to join. Explain to them how your Marketplace is beneficial. Answer their Questions.


5. Write knowledable content.
Write content that is useful to Audience. Dont be Salesy. They must feel friendly.
So when they buy, they are comfortable to query and quickly make decision and give priority to you over unknown strangers.


Once you have good number of users and network effect, your users will automatically increase and Business will scale.
