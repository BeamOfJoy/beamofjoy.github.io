### Opposites attract!

Collaborate with others.
But make sure both parties must be benefitted.
example:
John sells plants/saplings.
After purchasing plants, customers ask him where can they find pots.
He replies, you will find them on opposite site, 2nd shop.

Similary, the customer who purchased Clothes might be looking for shoes.

If your businesses are far away physically, you can put a small poster of your business.
Exchange with other complimentary business.

## Spread your knowledge.
- Stories are getting more popularity.
- You can keep valuable tips on your whatsapp/facebook/instagram status.
- Make sure the tip is short and crisp. Pint sized.
- keep the frequency low, so you do not irritate others.
- This will win trust and you gain business through word of mouth.

example: if you are cloth seller, instead of advertising products, share tips on how to protect the fabric color, washing tips.
Suggest fashion tips like combination of color or accessories.
